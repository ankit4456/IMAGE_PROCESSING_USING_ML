# 🧠 IMAGE_PROCESSING_USING_ML (Deep Learning)

**🏫 A College Hackathon Project – 3rd Place Winner!**

This project was built as part of a 2-hour hackathon conducted at our college fest. Given a real-world **image dataset from Kaggle**, our team of four analyzed and processed the data using machine learning and deep learning techniques. We achieved **89% accuracy** in classifying pistachio types – securing **3rd place**!

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **basic machine learning techniques** to classify two types of pistachios based on both image and feature datasets.

- 🌰 Pistachio Types: `Kirmizi_Pistachio` and `Siirt_Pistachio`
- 📈 Accuracy Achieved: **89%**
- 🧪 Techniques Used: SVM, regression, and other ML concepts
- 👨‍💻 Platform Used: Google Colab

## ⚙️ How to Run

### ✅ Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)

No setup needed! Just open the notebook and run it:

📌 [Open Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Lrvj02qNUqKmZZyQm-XfOy8_jBEYj21t?usp=sharing)

Make sure to:
1. Mount your Google Drive.
2. Upload the entire folder from the shared Google Drive link.
3. Update the path in the code as per your directory structure.

> Example:
> If you place the folder in your Drive root and name it `Pistachio_Dataset`, update paths in the code accordingly.

### ✅ Option 2: Local Environment

If you want to run it locally, you must install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib opencv-python
Then, download the dataset and point the code to your local directory.

📝 Notes from the Author
"This project happened during our college fest hackathon. We had just 2 hours, a team of four, and a Kaggle dataset. We used the time to apply everything we knew—from image processing to ML modeling—and built a working classifier. The project taught us a lot about quick thinking and teamwork. Proud to say, we achieved 3rd rank with an 89% accurate model!" – By Ankit Raj (Author & Team Lead)

💬 Final Thoughts
If you're new to ML or SVM, don't worry. Just observe the code and understand how data flows through preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. Learning from real projects is the best way to grow.

Feel free to fork, explore, and improve the project!
